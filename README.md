Tui Marvel Howe: Developing a custom python calculater

# Custom Python Calculator Assessment

## About my Project
This project is custom python calculater. using PYTHON I created a calculator for 11 - 13yr olds that had larger buttons for easier use, had complimentary colours to seperate the different buttons and I also decided to use simpler signs for students of all abilities to use. 

### Design Decisions:
- Age Group for calculator is **Intermediate students** (11-13yrs old)

- I have chosen the background colour to be **red** because it is colourful.
- The reason that I chose the **"+,-,x,/,=,. and Reset"** buttons to be **Green** was because it is the complimentary colour for red.
- The reason that I chose the numbers to be **yellow** was so that it compliments the background but so that is easier for 11-13yr olds to tell the difference between the control buttons and the numbers.

### Operations and Symbols
- The operations and symbols are simple because they most likely don't what **"*"** means
